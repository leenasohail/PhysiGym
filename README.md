# Abstract:

PhysiCell is a physics-based cell simulator for 3D multicellular systems.
More precisely, [PhysiCell](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell) is an agent-based model and diffusion transport solver that is off-lattice, center-based, multiscale in space and time, and written in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).

[Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/main/) is the API standard for reinforcement learning, written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).

The Python-based physigym module presented here was written on top of the python\_with\_physicell extending module from the [physicellembedding](https://github.com/elmbeech/physicellembedding) project, which makes it possible to extend the python interpreter to interact with PhysiCell models in the Python language.

Both, physigym and extending, are PhysiCell custom\_modules.

Walking through the tutorial, you will gain the understanding needed to tackle more complex PhysiCell-based reinforcement learning projects.
First, you will set up a very basic template model that can figure as a starting point for your own project.
Then you will learn on a somewhat more complex tumor\_immune\_base model how to deep reinforcement learn a policy using the sac (soft actor critic) algorithm.

**Limitations:** Because of the way how PhysiCell is implemented and run, it is not possible to generate more than one PhysiCell Gymnasium environment per runtime. A runtime warning will be thrown if you try to do so.

May the force be with you!

# Discussion:

To be developed.


# About Documentation:

Within the PhysiGym library, we tried to stick to the documentation policy laid out by Daniele Procida in his "[what nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azf6yzuJt54)" talk at PyCon 2017 in Portland, Oregon.
